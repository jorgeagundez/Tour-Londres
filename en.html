						<h1>Jack the Ripper, dark London.</h1>
					</br>
						<p>London is a mirror for the greatness of an empire and its economical, juridical and cultural power.</p>
					</br>
						<p>However, its history hides a dark side that transports us to a different period, when crime was widespread in an area punished by <span><strong>illness, disaster and overpopulation</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>The authority was non-existent and public punishment was used for entertainment. Death was worth more than life itself.</p>
					</br>
						<p>In this tour we’ll walk through  <span><strong>those hidden corners of London </span></strong>, bringing back memories of horrific stories: <span><strong>the Black Death</strong></span>, the cholera, executions as we continue in the footsteps of the most famous murderer of all time series, <span><strong>Jack the Ripper</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>A murderer who in the fall of 1888 appears to show terror in the dark streets, and whose identity has been a mystery creating a legend that is still present in the streets of the East End.</p>
					</br>
						<p>In more than 2 hours <span><strong>we will walk through the places that marked forever the most disadvantaged part of London</span></strong>. A tour that will surprise you!</p>

						<h1>Tour de Southwark</h1>
					</br>
						<p>In 1951, following a great refurbishment to encourage the English people after the damage and losses of <span><strong>the Second World War</span></strong>, <span><strong>the Great Britain festival was created in South Bank</span></strong>. Nowadays its diverse museums mix with concert halls and theatres as well as the <span><strong>London Eye</span></strong> and the <span><strong>London Aquarium</span></strong> which have made of the south west shore of the river a very popular destination.</p>
					</br>

					</br>
						<p>Discover in this tour the stories behind <span><strong>the people that marked the area, like Shakespeare, Dickens or Charles Chaplin</span></strong>, and its influence in the theatres that emerged when the puritan government forbade them in the rest of London</p>
					</br>
						<p>Take part in the <span><strong>history by knowing the marks left in prisons, cathedrals, pubs and markets</span></strong> that are today a living memory of the essence of a pretty unknown London that after this tour will be unforgettable</p>

						<h1>Westminster, London Palaces.</h1>
					</br>
						<p>Inside the Greater London, Westminster has always been an important neighbourhood due to its status as the favourite residential area of the English high class. In this tour through one of the most emblematic areas of London we will find the greatest symbols of the city along with some majestic royal homes.</p>
					</br>
						<p>We will get to know the history of <span><strong>Buckingham Palace</span></strong>, where takes place the most visited changing of guard in the world. In the shadow of the charisma of Buckingham Palace we will come across the less known but not less impressive <span><strong>St James Palace</strong></span>, with nearly 500 years of history. Built on a whim of the bloodthirsty Henry VIII it has seen time pass surrounded by one of the most picturesque natural environments of the city. But we will not only visit palaces in this tour, but we will also pass through places as emblematic as <span><strong>Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square or the London Eye</strong></span>, to finally arrive to <span><strong>Westminster Abbey and the Palace of Westminster</strong></span>, where modern democracy was born and where we will finally find out what the famous Big Ben really is</p>

						<h1>The City of London, the beginning of London</h1>
					</br>
						<p>Did you know that London comprised a surface of just 1.6 km2 during almost all its history? It wasn’t until 1965 that, after an administrative fusion of several adjoining municipalities, the City of London came to be a part of what we call today the Greater London, the London we hear about in the news, with millions of inhabitants and thousands of square kilometres of extension.</p>
					</br>
						<p>In this tour you will go into <span><strong>the beginnings of the real London</span></strong>. A walk through the history of the most important milestones of the city, like <span><strong>the arrival of the Roman Imperium, the Norman occupation, the Great Fire of London and the Second World War</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>You may be surprised when you learn that the Big Ben or Buckingham Palace were not a part of London until this administrative fusion, however, in this tour you will get to know better some of the other emblems of the capital such as <span><strong>St Paul’s Cathedral</span></strong>, <span><strong>the London Bridge, the Tower Bridge or the Tower of London</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
				    	<p><span><strong>A walk through the past, present and future</span></strong> of an ancient city that has been forced to come back from its ashes several times but today is the most important financial area of Europe, where the tall and modern new skyscrapers coexist with majestic medieval buildings filled with history.</p>

						<h1>The London of Harry Potter</h1>
					</br>
						<p>When J.K. Rowling, author of the successful Harry Potter saga was given the chance to take her novels to the big screen she asked for an important condition before giving the green light to the project: <span><strong>all the movies had to be filmed in UK’s locations and scenery</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>That takes us straight to a London where <span><strong>the magical world of Harry Potter</span></strong> coexists with the daily muggle life. In this tour we will walk through some of London’s most famous spots, and others less known, that were used in the filming of these magical movies: from <span><strong>the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in The Philosopher’s Stone</span></strong>, to the streets where <span><strong>the triple-decker in Azkaban’s Prisoner went through</span></strong>, not to forget the guest entrance to <span><strong>the Ministry of Magic or the bridge destroyed by the Death Eaters in The Half-Blood Prince</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>But we will not only walk across the film settings but also through symbolic places such as the square where the red carpet for the premiere of the last movie was set, the entrance to the cinemas where all the premieres took place or the street that inspired J.K Rowling when creating the crowded Diagon Alley.</p>
					</br>
						<p><span><strong>A tour for Harry Potter lovers and their companions alike</span></strong>, since in our route we’ll also learn about muggle monuments as well-known as <span><strong>Tower Bridge or The Tower of London</span></strong>, <span><strong>Borough Market</span></strong>, <span><strong>the Millennium Bridge</span></strong>, <span><strong>The Houses of Parliament</span></strong>, <span><strong>The Big Ben</span></strong>, <span><strong>The London Eye</span></strong>, <span><strong>10th Downing Street</span></strong>, <span><strong>Trafalgar Square or Leicester Square</span></strong>.</p>
					</br>
						<p>For this tour we will need to use the public transport at least once, so <span><strong>we recommend all the party members to have a day travel card for zones 1-2 or an Oyster card with enough balance</span></strong>. They can also be purchased at any underground station along the route if necessary. The price of the public transport is not included in the tour’s price.</p>
